### Intro
* Constantly changing
* May invovle multiple people or orgs...

# Social engineering Principles
## 1. Authority
- The social engineer is in charge
- E.G: call as an CEO/ C-level.

## 2. Intimidation
* There will be bad things if you don't have
* **E.G: If you won't have me, the payroll checks won't be processed

## 3. Consensus - Social proof
- Convince based on what's normally expected
- **E.G: 
		Your co-worker Jill did this for me last week
		Fake facebook post with lots of comments, like, interaction on some reputation check
		
## 4. Scarcity & Urgency
## Scarcity
* The situation will not be this way for long
* Must make the change before time expires
* **E.G:
		Message claim the prize immediately?

## Urgency
* Works alongside scarcity
* Act quickly, don't think
		**FOMO!!!
		
## 5. Familiarity / Liking
- Someone you know, we have common   friends!

## 6. Trust
- Someone who is safe, trustable
- E.G: I'm from IT department and I'm here to help
