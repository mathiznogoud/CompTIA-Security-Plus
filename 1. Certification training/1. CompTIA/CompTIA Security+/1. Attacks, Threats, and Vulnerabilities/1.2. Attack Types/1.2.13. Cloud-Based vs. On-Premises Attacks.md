## Notable mentions
1. Cloud-based security is centralized and costs less
2. On-premise puts the security burden on the client.




## On-premises security
- Customize your security posture -> FULL CONTROL when everything is in-house
- Onsite IT team can manage security better.
- Local team maintains uptime and AVAILABILITY
- Security changes can take time (new equip, configs, costs...)


# Security in the cloud
* Data is in a secure environment (***But 3RD PARTY may have access to your data!!)
* Cloud providers are managing large-scale security -> Automated signature & security updates, user must follow best-practices.
* Limited downtime -> 24/7/365 monitoring
* Scalable security options.
