# Plaintext
Widely open for everyone can read .......



# Hashing a password
1. Using an algorithm to "hash" the password...
2. Only hash the original password? -> that's why we need to add the "salt"!


# Spraying attack
* Using common password -> wordlist (rockyou.txt)
* To avoid detection or lockout threshold -> try with top 2, top 3 common password, if they don't work -> Move to the next account
##### E.G: employee1@company.com -> not success -> attack employee2@company.com -> and repeat the process

# Brute-force attack
* Try every possible password combination....
E.G : "De-hash" a hash value -> hashcat, jwt bruteforcer,.....
* Often used to brute force offline (hash cracker) since online bruteforce usually lead to account lockout

# Dictionary attack
* Use a dictionary to find common words to use in a password -> combine them.
* Customized dictionary such as: Vietnam common password, hospital common phrase, password.
* Can substitute letters! (E.G p4ssw0rd instead of password)

# Rainbow tables
* Use a pre-built hash
* MD5 hash cracker database -> rainbow tables
* With salt, without salt, IV... double MD5.... double SHA....


# SALT!!! (double salt, triple salt!!!)
Just add more complexity -> Slow down the bruteforce process, make rainbow table useless!
