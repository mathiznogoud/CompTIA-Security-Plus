1. Memory vulnerabilities
	* Memory leak (Unused memory is not properly release)
	* NULL Pointer dereference
	* Interger overflow (Large number into a smaller sized space)
2. Directory traversal / path traversal
	* Read file from a webserver that are outside of the website's file directory
	* Could be a software vuln, code vuln...
3. Improper error handling
	* Error message could have too much information -> lead to information leakage
4. Improper input handling
	* Could lead to SQL injections, buffer overflows, DoS,...
5. API attacks
	* Attacker look for vulnreabilities in this communication path.
6. Resource exhaustion
	* A specialized DoS attack
	* E.G: 
		- ZIP bomb
		- DHCP Starvation (or DHCP Flooding)
