## Types of injection attacks
1. Code Injection/Command injection
	* Adding your own information into a data stream
	* Could inject HTML, SQL, XML, LDAP, Python, Linux commands,....
2. SQL Injection
	* Inject SQL statements, query to a web/desktop application.
	* Usually happend when dev is too stoopid to sanitize the input/output, or too dumb to use best-practices security programming.
3. XML injection (XXE) / LDAP Injection
	* Inject XML data to make the system perform unwanted actions.
	* LDAP injection: modify LDAP requests/queries to manipulate the results -> Data breach?
4. DLL Injection
	* Inject a malicious DLL to run malicious code/functionality from that DLL from a TRUSTED program.
