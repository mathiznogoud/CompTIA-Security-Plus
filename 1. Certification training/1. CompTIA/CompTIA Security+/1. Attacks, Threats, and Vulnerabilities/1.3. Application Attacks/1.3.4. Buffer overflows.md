## Generals
* Overwriting a buffer of memory
	* Spills over into other memory areas
* Not a SIMPLE exploit
* Devs need to perform bounds checking
## Types of buffer overflows
*  **Stack-based buffer overflows** are more common, and leverage stack memory that only exists during the execution time of a function.

* ***Heap-based attacks** are harder to carry out and involve flooding the memory space allocated for a program beyond memory used for current runtime operations.



## Examples.
* Let's say you have 2 variables ***a*** and ***b***
* var a can only store 5 letters, var b is right next to var ***a*** in a memory buffer
* If you input 6 letters -> it will override the last letter to var b -> causing a buffer over flows
