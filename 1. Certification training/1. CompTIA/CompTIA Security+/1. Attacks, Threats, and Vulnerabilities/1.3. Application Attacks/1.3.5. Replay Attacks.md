## Generals
1. Sniffing data over the network
2. Attacker will need access to the raw network data, this including:
	* Network tap
	* ARP poisoning
	* Malware
3. The gathered information may help the attacker
4. THIS IS NOT AN ON-PATH ATTACK, WHY?
	* The actual replay doesn't require the original workstation

## Type of attacks:
1. Pass the hash

How to mitigate this? -> ENCRYPTION OR USE SALT.

2. Session hijacking (Sidejacking)
* Could use wireshark, kismet, XSS....
* Attacker could use the session or JWT token for example ... to impersonate as the victim to do malicious actions.
