#Generals 
#### RFID (Radio-frequency identification)
* Access badges
* Inventory/Assembly line tracking
* Radar technology
	* Radio energy trasmitted to the tag
	* RF powers the tag, ID is transmitted back
	* Bi-directional communication
	* Some tag formats can be active/powered
#### Near field communication (NFC)
* Two-way wireless communication
* Payment systems
* Bootstrap for other wireless
* Access token, identity "card" (could be in a device, card key,...)

#Attacks
### RFID Attacks:
* Data capture
	* View communication
	* Replay attack
	* Spoof the reader -> modify the content of the RFID
	* DoS -> Signal jamming
	* Decrypt communication (many default keys are on Google)

### NFC security concerns:
* Remote capture
* Frequency jamming
* Relay/Replay attack
* Loss of RFC device control (stolen/lost phone)
