#Attacks 
* MAC Flooding
	* The MAC table is only so big
	* Attacker starts sending traffic with different source MAC addresses -> table fills up -> flooding traffic to all interfaces
	* The switch eventually turns into a hub -> All traffic is transmitted to all interfaces -> capture network traffic (PROFIT??)
	* Could be restricted.
* MAC cloning / MAC Spoofing
	* Modified MAC address to match another MAC of an existing device
	* To evade filter/resitrction based on MAC filtering
	* Create a DoS (If victim MAC is known)
