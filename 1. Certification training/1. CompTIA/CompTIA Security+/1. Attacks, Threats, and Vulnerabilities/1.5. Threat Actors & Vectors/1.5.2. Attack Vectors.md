#Generals 
* Attack vectors:
	* A method used by the attacker
	* A lot of work goes into finding vulnerabilities in these vectors
	* IT Security pros spend their career watching these vectors

#TypesOfAttackVectors
* ### Direct access attack vectors (Physical)
	* Direct access to hardware... 
	* Modify the operating system
	* Key logger...
	* Transfer files...
	* Denial of Service
* ### Wireless Attack vectors
	* Default login creds
	* Rogue access point
	* Evil twin
	* Protocal vulnerabilities
* ### Email attack vectors
	* Phishing attacks
	* Deliver the malware to user
	* Social engineering attacks
* ### Supply chain attack vectors
	* Tamper with the underlying infrastructure (or manufacturing process)
	* Usally attacker will attack to a 3rd party to chain -> target
* ### Social media attack vectors
	* PII online...
	* User profiling (could be used to generate wordlist against you)
* ### Removeable media attack vectors
	* USB -> BYPASS FIREWALL!
	* Malicious software on USB Flash Drives...
	* Data exfiltration -> Data loss
* ### Cloud attack vectors
	* Publicly-facing applications and services
	* Security misconfigurations
	* Bruteforce attack - or phishing.
	* Orchestration attacks (Make the cloud build new application instances -> Auto-scaling ftw...)
	* Denial of service
