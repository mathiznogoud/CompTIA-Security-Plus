#Generals 
* IT Security doesn't change because it's a third party
* Always expect the worst
* Human error is still the biggest issue

#TypeOfTPRisk
1. System integration risk
	* Professional installation and maintenance
	* Can be onsite
	* Can run software on the internal network
2. Lack of vendor support
	* Security requires diligence
	* Vendors are the only ones who can fix their products
3. Supply chain risk
	* You can't always control security at a 3rd party location
4. Oursourced code development
	* Accessing the codebase
		* Internal access over a VPN
		* Cloud-based access
	* Development system should be isolated
	* Test the code security.
5. Data storage
	* Consider the type of data -> apply restriction
	* Always encrypt in transit
