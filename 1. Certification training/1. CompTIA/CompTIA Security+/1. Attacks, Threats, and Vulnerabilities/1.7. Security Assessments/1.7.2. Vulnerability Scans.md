#Generals 
* Usually minimally invasive <-> Unlike a penetration test
* Port scan
* Identify systems
* Test from the outside & inside
* Gather as much information as possible

#ScanTypes
1. Non-intrusive scan
	* Gather information, don't try to exploit a vulnerability
2. Intrusive scan
	* Try to exploit the vuln
3. Non-credentialed scans / Credentialed scan
4. Identify vulnerabilities - Web, app, network scans
5. Dealing with false positive
	* FP -> A vuln is identified that doesn't really exist, or just a low priority incorrectly identified as critical
	* False Negative -> A vuln exists, but scanner didn't detect it.
6. Configuration review
